# ROOP-AI-Deepfakes
This tool will help you to use AI to create deepfakes any photo/video with the help of Google Collab.

I've tried to make it as simple and accessible as possible, requiring just 7 simple steps and you can do this on any platform with access to a modern web browser.

# THINGS YOU WILL NEED
1. A google account
2. Access to an undisrupted internet connection
3. A source image
4. A target video (the lesser things over the face the better)
5. Patience 

# STEPS TO MAKE A CONVINCING DEEPFAKE

1. Open the Collab link in a new tab and connect it with Google's T4 GPU

2. Start the step-1 of the project, you will see a little green check mark after it's done with the tasks. This one might take a while.

3. Start step-2 of the process. This one is rather faster and would be done in under 2 minutes, after which you'll see a green check mark again.

4. Click on the menu icon on the top left and click on "Show File Browser".

5. Upload both, your input image and target image/ video here, you're free to rename it at this point.

6. In the step-3 command, rename "vid.mov" to your target video (making sure if capitalisation and file type) and "clown.png" to your input picture (or don't, you'll see the video with Pennywise if not :P)

-> you can edit the arguments to reduce/ increase the workload like adding "-- skip audio"(that doesn't process audio) or removing "-- many faces"(when your video just has one face to work with) among many others. refer to the original ROOP documentation for more.

7. Execute step-3 and wait until it shows a check mark as well. Upon completion, you'll find your deepfake named "Swapped.mp4" in the file browser, which you can download.

# and that's all! you're done :)
